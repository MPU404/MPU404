👋 Hi, I’m @MPU404
👀 I’m interested in system-level programming with C and C++  
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced data structures, algorithms, and memory management in C and C++  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source C/C++ projects, especially those involving performance optimization, embedded systems, or game development   
⚡ Fun fact: I love exploring low-level programming concepts and optimizing code for speed and efficiency!
